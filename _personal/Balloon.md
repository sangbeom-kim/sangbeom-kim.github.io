  Description  

  {:.content}
  The Balloon Adventure is a 2D platformer game where the main character is a balloon. Players progress by utilizing properties of real balloons, such as floating, deflating, and charging static electricity to reach the goal. This was my Unity team project submitted to a game contest in South Korea, where it won an award.
